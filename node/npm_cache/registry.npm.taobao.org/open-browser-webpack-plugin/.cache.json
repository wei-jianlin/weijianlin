Open Browser Webpack Plugin\nOpens a new browser tab when Webpack loads. Very useful if you're lazy and don't want to force yourself to open a new tab when Webpack is ready to play!\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install open-browser-webpack-plugin --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply require the plugin and add it in the **plugins** section:\n\n```javascript\nvar OpenBrowserPlugin = require('open-browser-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'lib/entry.js'),\n  output: {\n    path: __dirname + \"/bundle/\",\n    filename: \"bundle.js\"\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new OpenBrowserPlugin({ url: 'http://localhost:3000' })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n## Options\n\n#### url\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `http://localhost:8080`\n\nUrl to open when Webpack is ready. Needs to have the prefix `http://` or `https://` in order to open the browser.\n\n#### delay\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `0`<br>\nOptional\n\nBy default the browser is opened immediately, but this could be too early in some cases (eg. starting a nodeJS server).\nThe value is specified in milliseconds.\n\n#### browser\n\nType: `String`<br>\nOptional\n\nBrowser to open. By default, it will try to open the browser set by default in your system.\n\n#### ignoreErrors\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `False`<br>\nOptional\n\nBy default this plugin only opens the browser if there's no Webpack errors. Setting ignoreErrors to true will open a new tab no matter the compilation errors.\n\n## Change Log\n\n### 0.0.5 - 2017-03-09\n#### Fixes\n- Fix issue where the compilation never ends. (Thanks to @vkalinichev)\n\n### 0.0.4 - 2017-02-19\n#### Fixes\n- Fix issue where other Webpack callbacks were removed. (Thanks to @plemarquand)\n\n### 0.0.3 - 2016-10-31\n#### Added\n- delay option (Thanks to @Root-Core)\n\n### 0.0.2 - 2015-12-26\n#### Added\n- ignoreErrors option (Thanks to @zhura).\n- Changelog.\n- Documentation for options.\n\n#### Removed\n- DEFAULT_BROWSER constant.\n\n### 0.0.1 - 2015-09-12\n- First release.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.\n","_attachments":{},"homepage":"https://github.com/baldore/webpack-open-plugin#readme","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/baldore/webpack-open-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","_etag":"\"27fe-5ENWSa5ELVVMYkLd3RU93M9yWaI\""}
